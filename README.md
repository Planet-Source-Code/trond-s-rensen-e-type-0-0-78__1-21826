### Description

Multi Document Text editor with many functions.

This is a project I started 18 months ago. It grew out of control and I now have realized I will probably never have time to finish it. Therefore I now release it for you guys to use.

All I ask is: If you use it for anything, let me know. The name is mine to use with a text editor.

The program is almost finished. A few bugs still have to be sorted out. Let me know if you find a solution for them.

Read the text file, E-Type.txt, included in the zipfile. It contains todolist and credits to the people, who I have ether got help from, ideas from or borrowed snippets from.
