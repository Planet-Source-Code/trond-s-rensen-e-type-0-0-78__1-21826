Status:
Linenumbers do not scroll together with scrollbar. 
File Association is working. Restart of windows is needed to se the canged icons 
Still working on Document tabs. 

Document index is giving me a headache. Must sort it out since many functions rely on this..

Find files from find dialog working. Still lacks visual working.

So little time, so much still remains to do. Will I ever get this product finished?

Todo: (In order of importance)
- Multiple undo/redo
- When changing font type and color, all open windows must be updated with the new settings
- Revert To Saved file function enabled even if document is not saved
- History in filemneu not always working. Check if "UpdateFileMenu" or "GetRecentFiles" is the righ sub to use!
- Startup functions from Options dialogen not yet finished. Is it possible to set tab size in rtf?.
- Closing of sidebar somtimes opens empty windows. The old document index bug?
- Dobbleclicking on files on sidebar explorer somethimes opens the new file in an already existing window. 
- Rightclick chooses documenttab would have been nice
- Restore of minimized windows not repainting windows
- History menu on sidebar explorer allways has an empty line on top which I named "History"
- Visual work on scroll bars and margins on print preview
- Sidebar explorer not showing all files when all files selected
- Save all function not saving all documents
                     

Done:
- Now Sorts text both Ascending og Descending
- Undo and redo buttons on toolbar unable to call private sub from frmNotepad.
- SelNextWindow and SelPrevWindow not working with deleted windows
- Select window on toolbar gets the Find dialog as a document window
- Sort rutine  deletes top line in sorted text
- Sidebar explorer not showing hidden files

In next version:
- Implement ftp load and save
- Active line coloring would have been nice
- Saving MultiClip clips to file for later use
- Load system files function
- Autofunction to sett font after doc extensions i.e. .nfo files opens with terminal font
