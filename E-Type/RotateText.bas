Attribute VB_Name = "modRotateText"
Option Explicit

' Just tested this in vb6.
' Rotates the text applied to a picturebox.
'
' Add a picture box to a form. For best looks make
' it flat borderless and align it to left or right.
' Remember to choose a truetype font in the picture box.
' The default MS Sans Serif will not work!
' Sett the font type, font size and collors to the picturebox
' In form load call it like this:
' Call RotateText("Text goes here", picture1)
